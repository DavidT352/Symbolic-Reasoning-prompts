# Horoscope Spread — Brotherhood of Light Tarot

## Objective
Guide an LLM to interpret a **structured symbolic system** (Brotherhood of Light Tarot) using a **12-house Horoscope Spread**. The focus is on **reasoning, pattern recognition, and narrative coherence** — not divination.

This prompt demonstrates how to encode a symbolic framework and keep the model **strictly within one system**. The engineering challenge expands beyond compact spreads by enforcing **house semantics**, **placement vs. reading order**, **cross-house synthesis (trinities)**, and **relational indexing** across 12 positions.

---

## Why This Prompt Is Technically Challenging
- **Scale & Memory:** 12 interdependent positions stress long-context consistency.
- **Dual Orders:** Distinguishes **layout order (placement)** from **reading order (trinities)** — easy for models to confuse.
- **Relational Indexing:** Minor numbers must map to the **Major of the same number**, then be **filtered by suit element**.
- **Leak Prevention:** Strictly locks to Brotherhood of Light titles, correspondences, and semantics.
- **Local vs. Global Coherence:** Each house has a local meaning; trinities and repeating motifs must form a global narrative.
- **Deterministic Procedure Simulation:** Shuffling, reversals, and house assignment must be executed without bias.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Emphasize AI reasoning over tarot:** Uses the Brotherhood of Light purely as a **formal symbolic system** (numbers, elements, archetypes) for pattern recognition, analogy, and narrative construction — not fortune-telling.  
- **(Relational Indexing) Minor ↔ Major mapping:** **Minor Arcana numbers correspond to the Major Arcana of the same number**, filtered through suit elements.  
- **Prompt precision:** Enforces strict card titles, correspondences, reversals behavior, and house semantics.  
- **Cross-structure synthesis:** Interprets **trinities** (1-5-9, 2-6-10, 3-7-11, 4-8-12) for higher-order themes.

## Prompt

### Question
> “What surrounds my life during the next 3 months?”  
> *(Replace with your question as needed.)*

Assume the querent seeks **clarity, reflection, and guidance**.

---

## System Rules (Do Not Deviate)
- Use only the **Brotherhood of Light Tarot** system (Church of Light lessons **CS06 & CS07**).
- **Do not** use Golden Dawn, Rider–Waite, Thoth, or any other tarot system correspondences or card titles.
- Use **official Brotherhood of Light** titles: e.g., *The Alchemist, The Two Paths, The Spiritualist, The Star,* etc.
- Apply **Major Arcana** meanings **exactly** as in CS06 & CS07.
- Interpret **Minor Arcana** strictly via:
  - **Numerical correspondence** to the **Major of the same number**, then  
  - **Suit element** filter.  
- Court Cards: follow **Brotherhood of Light** zodiac/element correspondences and personality traits **only**.

---

## Spread Instructions

### Layout Order (Placement)
Draw **12 cards** from the full 78-card deck. Simulate shuffling using the traditional **three-pile** method, with **reversals** appearing naturally.

Place cards in houses in this order:
- **Angular houses:** 1 → 10 → 7 → 4  
- **Cadent houses:** 12 → 9 → 6 → 3  
- **Succedent houses:** 11 → 8 → 5 → 2

> **Note:** When a **Major** appears in any house, that life area is **especially significant**.

### Reading Order (Interpretation via Trinities)
Interpret in this sequence:
- **Trinity of Life** → Houses **1, 5, 9**
- **Trinity of Wealth** → Houses **2, 6, 10**
- **Trinity of Associations** → Houses **3, 7, 11**
- **Trinity of Psychism** → Houses **4, 8, 12**

---

## Card Interpretation Instructions
- Use **official Brotherhood of Light** card titles.
- Include **astrological correspondences** lightly and professionally.
- Note **upright/reversed** and explain in context of the **house**.
- Interpret using **symbols, numbers, imagery,** and **position**; blend analytical reasoning with a **coherent narrative**.
- **Reversed** = **slowed/delayed** expression (not an opposite meaning).
- **Minor Arcana rule:**  
  1) Map the **number** to the **Major of the same number**,  
  2) Filter by **suit element**,  
  3) Apply **upright/reversed** nuances.

---

## Minor Arcana Interpretation (Elements)
- **Coins → Air** → ideas, work, money  
- **Scepters → Fire** → career, ambition, action  
- **Cups → Water** → emotions, relationships  
- **Swords → Earth** → struggle, protection, decision-making

## Summary

The next three months emphasize **personal empowerment (Magus), creative inspiration (Star), and deep transformation (Reaper + Moon)**. Ambition in career is strong, but requires balance and patience to avoid wasted effort (Horseman of Scepters reversed).  

Partnerships may feel uncertain (Two Paths reversed), but allies (Queen of Cups) provide stability. Transformation in shared matters (Reaper) and inner reflection (Moon) mark this as a season of renewal and letting go.  

**Actionable Approach:**  
- Anchor ambition with structure and balance (The Balance).  
- Trust inspiration while clarifying intellectual direction.  
- Accept transformations in bonds; release creates space for growth.  
- Avoid haste in career or resource decisions; steady progress wins.
