# Magic Seven Spread — Brotherhood of Light Tarot

## Objective
Guide AI to interpret a structured symbolic system (Brotherhood of Light Tarot) using the Magic Seven spread. Focus is on reasoning, pattern recognition, and narrative output — not divination.  

> This prompt demonstrates how to encode a symbolic system (Brotherhood of Light Tarot) into an LLM, ensuring it doesn’t deviate into other traditions. The engineering challenge was enforcing strict correspondences, court card naming, and spread structure.

## Question Example
"I recently completed an AI prompt-writing interview. I passed the test, and now I need to build my profile. Provide insight on this situation and the likely outcome."

---

## Spread Instructions
1. Simulate shuffling the deck using the traditional method (cut into three piles from right to left, some cards reversed).  
2. Draw 7 cards for the Magic Seven spread in this order:  
   - Nature of the Problem  
   - Forces in the Environment  
   - Spiritual / Inner Influences  
   - Recent Past  
   - Present  
   - Future  
   - Final Outcome / Key to Resolution  

---

## Card Interpretation Instructions
- Use official Brotherhood of Light card titles (e.g., The Alchemist, The Two Paths, The Magus, etc).  
- Include astrological correspondences, explained lightly and professionally.  
- Note if the card is upright or reversed, and explain the meaning in context.  
- Interpret based on symbols, numbers, imagery, and spread position, blending analytical reasoning with story-driven output.  
- Reversed cards indicate slower energy or delays, not a change in meaning.
