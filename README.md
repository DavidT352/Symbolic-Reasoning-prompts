# Symbolic Reasoning Prompts

A portfolio project exploring **structured symbolic reasoning** using the *Brotherhood of Light Tarot*.  
This is not mystical or divinatory — the symbolic system is simply a framework to **test AI’s ability in reasoning, analogy, and narrative coherence**.

## Purpose

This project uses the Brotherhood of Light Tarot purely as a formal symbolic system, allowing AI to reason through numbers, elements, and archetypes. It is a framework for pattern recognition, analogy, and narrative construction — not fortune-telling.

This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering by guiding AI to interpret a symbolic system with:

- **Strict structural rules** (spread positions, symbolic correspondences).  
- **Layered reasoning** (symbols, philosophy, narrative).  
- **Story-driven outputs** that remain coherent and user-relevant.  

The aim:

- Showcase **pattern recognition** and structured reasoning.  
- Convert complex, layered material into **accessible outputs**.  
- Demonstrate **creativity, discipline, and engineering precision**.

## Why the Brotherhood of Light Tarot?

- Rich symbolic structure and philosophy, well-documented.  
- Easy to constrain into rules — ideal for testing model discipline.  
- Familiar yet distinct enough to avoid “default tarot” drift.

### Features
- **Question-driven** → outputs change depending on user input.
- **Exploratory** → users can try their own spreads and see symbolic reasoning in action.
- **Dynamic** → shows how prompts adapt contextually.
- **Relational Indexing**: Minor Arcana numbers correspond to Major Arcana by number, with each suit filtering how the energy is expressed. This creates a structured, multi-layered reasoning challenge for AI, emphasizing numerical, elemental, and symbolic relationships.

### The Engineering Challenge
Designing prompts that:
- Force the model to stick to the Brotherhood of Light system (no Rider–Waite or Golden Dawn leakage).
- Translate symbol + philosophy + position into layered meaning.
- Enforce Minor Arcana numerical correspondence filtered through suit elements.
- Adapt dynamically to any user question without breaking narrative or symbolic coherence.

## Example Snippet

> **Position 3 — The Path Forward (The Alchemist / Taurus)**  
> This symbol represents steady transformation. Like soil turning into fruit, your progress requires patience. Taurus adds the theme of persistence — growth is quiet but unstoppable. Together, they suggest your path is built through small, deliberate actions rather than sudden leaps.

✨ **Why this works as a portfolio piece:**  
It’s multi-layered, disciplined, and creative. It shows the ability to:

- Build prompts that enforce strict symbolic frameworks.  
- Generate reasoning + storytelling outputs.  
- Balance **creativity** with **precision engineering**.
