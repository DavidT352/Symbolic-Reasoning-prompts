# Symbolic Reasoning Prompts

***Exploring how strict symbolism can unlock AI’s deepest reasoning patterns.*** 

*A portfolio project exploring structured symbolic reasoning using the Brotherhood of Light Tarot.*  

This is **not mystical or divinatory** — the symbolic system is simply a framework to test AI’s ability in reasoning, analogy, and narrative coherence.

## 🎯 Purpose  

This project uses the **Brotherhood of Light Tarot** purely as a **formal symbolic system**, allowing AI to reason through numbers, elements, and archetypes. It is a framework for **pattern recognition, analogy, and narrative construction** — not fortune-telling.  

It demonstrates advanced prompt engineering by guiding AI to interpret a symbolic system with:  
- **Strict structural rules** (spread positions, symbolic correspondences).  
- **Layered reasoning** (symbols, philosophy, narrative).  
- **Story-driven outputs** that remain coherent and user-relevant.  
- **Relational indexing** teaching an LLM to align smaller elements (like numeric sequences) with larger conceptual structures.

## 🃏 Why the Brotherhood of Light Tarot?  

- Rich symbolic structure and philosophy, well-documented.  
- Easy to constrain into rules — ideal for testing model discipline.  
- Familiar yet distinct enough to avoid “default tarot” drift.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Question-driven** → outputs change depending on user input.  
- **Exploratory** → users can try their own spreads and see symbolic reasoning in action.  
- **Dynamic** → shows how prompts adapt contextually.  
- **Relational Indexing** → Minor Arcana numbers correspond to Major Arcana by number, with each suit filtering how the energy is expressed.

## ⚙️ The Engineering Challenge  

Designing prompts that:  
- Force the model to **stick to the Brotherhood of Light system** (no Rider–Waite or Golden Dawn leakage).  
- Translate **symbol + philosophy + position** into layered meaning.  
- Enforce **Minor Arcana numerical correspondence** filtered through suit elements.  
- Adapt dynamically to **any user question** without breaking narrative or symbolic coherence.

## 📝 Example Snippet  

**Position 3 — The Path Forward (The Alchemist / Taurus)**  
> This symbol represents steady transformation. Like soil turning into fruit, your progress requires patience. Taurus adds the theme of persistence — growth is quiet but unstoppable. Together, they suggest your path is built through small, deliberate actions rather than sudden leaps.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated  

- Structured instruction-following  
- Contextual reasoning + pattern recognition  
- Analogy and symbolic interpretation  
- Multi-layered narrative generation  
- Creative but disciplined AI prompt design

## 🐍 Common Leaks & Debugging  

In symbolic reasoning projects, LLMs often “leak” into nearby but unintended frameworks (e.g., Rider–Waite tarot instead of Brotherhood of Light).  

The prompt design addresses this with:  
- **Domain-locked procedural prompts** → enforce strict use of the Brotherhood of Light system.  
- **Interpretation confinement** → prevent drift into other traditions.  
- **Relational indexing** → numerical correspondences anchor consistency across Major and Minor Arcana.  
- **Leak-resistant safeguards** → layered rules that punish drift and reinforce symbolic accuracy.

## 🌟 Why This Works as a Portfolio Piece  

It’s multi-layered, disciplined, and creative. It shows the ability to:  
- Build prompts that enforce strict symbolic frameworks.  
- Generate **reasoning + storytelling** outputs.  
- Balance **creativity with precision engineering**.
