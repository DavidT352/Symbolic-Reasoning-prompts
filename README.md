# Symbolic Reasoning Prompts

A collection of prompts using symbolic systems, like the Brotherhood of Light Tarot, to test AI's pattern recognition and reasoning. Focus is on analyzing symbols and underlying philosophy to generate meaningful answers to specific questions — not for divination purposes.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering by guiding AI to interpret complex symbolic systems. Each prompt blends analytical reasoning with storytelling, using symbols and underlying philosophies to generate structured, meaningful outputs.

The goal is **not mystical or divinatory**, but to leverage a rich symbolic system to:
- Test AI's pattern recognition
- Explore multi-layered reasoning
- Convert complex symbols and philosophy into coherent, human-relatable outputs

The Brotherhood of Light deck is ideal because it is structured, symbolic, and philosophically documented — making it a perfect system for creating deep, analogy-driven prompts.

## How to Use

- Explore individual prompts in the `prompts/` folder.
- Each prompt includes instructions, context, and professional commentary.
- Example AI outputs (optional) can be found in `example-outputs/`.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Structured instruction-following
- Contextual reasoning and pattern recognition
- Story-driven output generation
