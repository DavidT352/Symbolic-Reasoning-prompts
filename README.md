# Symbolic Reasoning Prompts

A portfolio project exploring **structured symbolic reasoning** using the *Brotherhood of Light Tarot*.  
This is not mystical or divinatory — the symbolic system is simply a framework to **test AI’s ability in reasoning, analogy, and narrative coherence**.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering by guiding AI to interpret a symbolic system with:

- **Strict structural rules** (spread positions, symbolic correspondences).  
- **Layered reasoning** (symbols, philosophy, narrative).  
- **Story-driven outputs** that remain coherent and user-relevant.  

The aim:

- Showcase **pattern recognition** and structured reasoning.  
- Convert complex, layered material into **accessible outputs**.  
- Demonstrate **creativity, discipline, and engineering precision**.  

---

## Why the Brotherhood of Light Tarot?

- Rich symbolic structure and philosophy, well-documented.  
- Easy to constrain into rules — ideal for testing model discipline.  
- Familiar yet distinct enough to avoid “default tarot” drift.  

---

## The Engineering Challenge

Designing prompts that:

- Force the model to **stick to this system** (no Rider–Waite or Golden Dawn leakage).  
- Translate **symbol + philosophy + position** into layered meaning.  
- Adapt dynamically to **any user question** without breaking narrative.  

---

## Features

- **Question-driven** → outputs change depending on user input.  
- **Exploratory** → users can try their own spreads and see symbolic reasoning in action.  
- **Dynamic** → shows how prompts adapt contextually.

## Example Snippet

> **Position 3 — The Path Forward (The Alchemist / Taurus)**  
> This symbol represents steady transformation. Like soil turning into fruit, your progress requires patience. Taurus adds the theme of persistence — growth is quiet but unstoppable. Together, they suggest your path is built through small, deliberate actions rather than sudden leaps.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Structured instruction-following  
- Contextual reasoning + pattern recognition  
- Analogy and symbolic interpretation  
- Multi-layered narrative generation  
- Creative but disciplined AI prompt design

## How to Use

1. Explore prompts in the `prompts/` folder.  
2. Example AI outputs in `example-outputs/`.  
3. Try your own questions with the provided prompt template.

## Prompt Attribution

Inspired by the *Brotherhood of Light* lessons, Church of Light (free online resources).  
For educational and portfolio use only.

✨ **Why this works as a portfolio piece:**  
It’s multi-layered, disciplined, and creative. It shows the ability to:

- Build prompts that enforce strict symbolic frameworks.  
- Generate reasoning + storytelling outputs.  
- Balance **creativity** with **precision engineering**.
