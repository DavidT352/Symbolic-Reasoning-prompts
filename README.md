# Symbolic Reasoning Prompts

**A structured symbolic reasoning prompt using a historical tarot system. The AI interprets multiple layers of meaning, integrating symbols, positions, and narrative to produce a coherent, story-driven output.**

**Note:** In short, the “mystical” and "symbolic" elements are just tools for complex reasoning and pattern recognition, not the point themselves — which makes this a serious, innovative AI prompt project.

A collection of prompts using symbolic systems, like the Brotherhood of Light Tarot, to test AI's pattern recognition and reasoning. Focus is on analyzing symbols and underlying philosophy to generate meaningful answers to specific questions — not for divination purposes.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering by guiding AI to interpret complex symbolic systems. Each prompt blends analytical reasoning with storytelling, using symbols and underlying philosophies to generate structured, meaningful outputs.

The goal is **not mystical or divinatory**, but to leverage a rich symbolic system to:
- Test AI's pattern recognition
- Explore multi-layered reasoning
- Convert complex symbols and philosophy into coherent, human-relatable outputs

The Brotherhood of Light deck is ideal because it is structured, symbolic, and philosophically documented — making it a perfect system for creating deep, analogy-driven prompts.

This project is **multi-layered and complex**, demonstrating the ability to design prompts that challenge AI reasoning, integrate philosophical context, and produce narrative-driven outputs. The complexity is a feature, showcasing creativity, precision, and advanced prompt engineering skills — making this a standout portfolio piece.

It is also **interactive and versatile**, allowing users to input their own questions:
- Each prompt is **question-driven** — AI outputs change depending on the user’s input.  
- It’s **playable and exploratory** — anyone can try their own questions and see the AI reason through symbols and philosophy.  
- Demonstrates **dynamic reasoning skills** — AI adapts to context, showing how prompts can generate tailored, meaningful outputs.
